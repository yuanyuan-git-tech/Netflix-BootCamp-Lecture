# Student Do: TDD with Arrays

Starter code: [./starter](./starter)

Solved code: [./solved](./solved)

For this activity, you will be adding to the `Calculator` project previously completed in this lesson.

## Instructions

Work in pairs to complete the following:

- Add failing tests for a `sumArrays` method. The method `sumArrays` should take two arrays and sum all the numbers in both arrays.

- Add a failing test for `arrayify`. The method `arrayify` should take in two integers. It should create an array that is the length of the first integer and that contains consecutive integers starting at the second integer. For example, `arrayify(3,5)` returns `[5,6,7]`.

- Once you have failing tests for a sufficient number of equivalence classes, write code to pass the tests.

> **Hint:** You'll need to import and use `assertArrayEquals` to compare arrays.
