# Find by Last Name and Company

In this activity, we will practice adding custom query methods to a JPA repository.

## Instructions

1. Open the `simple-crm-api` project in IntelliJ.

2. Add a custom query method to the `CustomerRepository` to find all customers by company.

3. Add a custom query method to the `CustomerRepository` to find all customers by last name and company.

4. Update the `CustomerController` to use the new methods you added to the `CustomerRepository`.

5. Test the controller using Insomnia to verify that the new methods are working.

> **Hint:** Refer to the [Spring Data JPA documentation on repository query keywords](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-query-keywords) and follow the same pattern used to find customers by last name.
