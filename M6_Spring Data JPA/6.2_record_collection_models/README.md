# Record Collection Models

In this activity, you will create models for the `record-collection` project.

## Instructions

1. Open the [starter project](./starter/record-collection/pom.xml) in IntelliJ.

2. Add a new `model` package to the project and create model classes to represent the following database tables from the `record_collection` database:

   - `album`

   - `artist`

   - `label`

   - `track`

   **Note:** Pay attention to the foreign keys and the relationships between tables.
