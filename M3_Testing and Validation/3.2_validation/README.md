# Student Do: Validation

**Starter & Solved Folders:** [02-stu-validation](./)

## Instructions

1. Add annotations to the `Record` DTO to ensure that none of the properties, other than `id`, are empty. Do not apply the annotation to the `id` property.

2. Once you've added the annotations to ensure the properties are not empty, open the [Oracle documentation on validation](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/validation/constraints/package-summary.html).

3. **Bonus**: Try to add an additional constraint that ensures the `year` property is exactly four digits.
