# Student Do: Adding Test Routes

**Starter & Solved Folders:** [05-stu-test-routes](./)

In this activity, you should expect the test cases to fail. The `RecordStoreController` functionality has not yet been implemented, and 404 HTTP responses should be returned. As we move forward, we will implement the `RecordStoreController` functionality and we will confirm each of these tests at that time.

## Instructions

Add a test for the `GET` route at `/records/{id}`.

Once you have completed that route, test the `PUT` and `DELETE` routes as well. Consider what to test if a method is expected to return nothing.
